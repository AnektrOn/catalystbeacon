# Push Local Code to New GitHub Repository

## Step 1: Create New GitHub Repository (You Do This)

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: (you choose - e.g., `hcuniversity` or `hcuniversity-clean`)
3. Make it **Private** or **Public** (your choice)
4. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
5. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Copy the Repository URL

After creating, GitHub will show you a URL like:
- `https://github.com/AnektrOn/YOUR-NEW-REPO-NAME.git`

Copy this URL - you'll need it in the next step.

## Step 3: Push Your Local Code (I'll Do This)

Once you give me the new repository URL, I will:

1. Connect your local code to the new GitHub repository
2. Push all your local files to GitHub
3. That's it!

## What You Need to Give Me:

Just the new repository URL, for example:
- `https://github.com/AnektrOn/hcuniversity.git`

---

**That's all! No branches, no confusion - just your local code going to a new clean GitHub repository.**
