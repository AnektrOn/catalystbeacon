## 📊 Information Architecture

### 1. **Navigation Bar** (Fixed Top)

**Why It Works**:
- Immediately communicates value

## 🎨 Design Principles Applied

### Color Strategy
- **Primary**: `#B4833D` (Golden) - Premium, warm, aspirational
- **Background**: Dark gradients (gray-900 to black) - Modern, elegant
- **Accents**: `#FFD700` (Bright gold) - Highlights, CTAs
- **Text**: White/Gray scale - Readability

### Typography
- **Headings**: Bold, 4xl-7xl sizes - Clear hierarchy
- **Body**: Gray-300/400 - Easy to read, not harsh
- **Emphasis**: Gradient text for key phrases

### Spacing
- Generous padding (py-20 sections)
- Consistent gaps (gap-8 in grids)
- Max-width containers (max-w-6xl)
- Breathing room for content

### Animations
**Subtle & Professional**:
- Hover state transitions on cards
- Border glow on hover
- Scale effects (scale-105 on popular plan)
- Parallax scroll on hero gradient orb

**NO More**:
- ❌ Spinning 3D objects
